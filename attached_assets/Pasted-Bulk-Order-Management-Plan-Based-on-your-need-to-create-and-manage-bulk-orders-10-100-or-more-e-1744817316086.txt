Bulk Order Management Plan
Based on your need to create and manage bulk orders (10, 100, or more) efficiently, here's my plan for enhancing the system:

1. Bulk Order Creation
I recommend implementing a multi-tiered approach to order creation:

Quick Single Order Creation
One-Click Order Creation: Add a floating action button (FAB) in the bottom right that opens a simplified form
Quick Template Selection: Include predefined templates for common orders (standard breakfasts, lunches, dinners)
AI-Assisted Input: Enable natural language input ("4 veg biryani, 2 butter naan, 3 mango lassi")
Bulk Order Creation Tools
CSV Upload: Allow uploading a spreadsheet of orders for immediate processing
Batch Creation Form: A dedicated interface where you can:
Specify number of orders to create (10, 50, 100)
Set common attributes (table ranges, status, meal types)
Configure randomization parameters (price ranges, item counts)
Copy Functionality: Select an existing order and "duplicate Ã— times" option
API Endpoint: For external system integration (Zomato/Swiggy bulk imports)
2. Bulk State Updates
Multi-Select Operations
Checkbox Selection: Add checkboxes to order cards for multi-selection
Floating Action Menu: When items are selected, show a floating menu with actions:
"Move all to [status]" options
"Generate bills for all"
"Print kitchen tokens"
"Cancel selected orders"
Batch Actions Per Column
Column Header Actions: Add a menu in each column header:
"Select all in this column"
"Move all to next stage"
"Print all tokens/bills"
Keyboard Shortcuts
Shift+Click: Select a range of orders
Ctrl+Click: Add to selection
Keyboard Commands: After selection, use keys like:
"M" then "P" = Move to Preparing
"M" then "R" = Move to Ready
etc.
3. UI Enhancements for Scale
Performance Optimizations
Virtualized Lists: Only render visible cards when dealing with 100+ orders
Pagination: Option to paginate columns (show 20 items per page)
Database Indexing: Ensure backend queries are optimized for bulk operations
Visual Organization
Grouping: Allow grouping orders by table number, source, or time range
Collapsible Groups: Click to expand/collapse groups of orders
Color Coding: Enhanced visual indicators for orders from different sources
Time Indicators: Visual indicators for orders that have been in a status too long
Filter & Search Enhancements
Advanced Filtering: Filter by multiple criteria simultaneously
Saved Filters: Save and name common filter combinations
Quick Filter Buttons: One-click filters for common scenarios
4. Implementation Approach
First phase: Add multi-select checkboxes and basic bulk operations
Second phase: Implement batch creation tools
Third phase: Add performance optimizations for large datasets
Fourth phase: Implement advanced UI features (grouping, saved filters)
